This is a portfolio project for Computer Science course at codeacademy.com. The task was to create a terminal program game, to practice coding in Python. "Tic-Tac-Toe" and "Battleship" are for children and my first idea was "Hookup in a city", but then I decided to make something more decent - simulator of stock market trading app. ChatGPT, as a perfect bullshit generator, provided company names and some fake market news for the interface. Player can view current market prices, buy and sell stocks and compare his performance with other investors. Some stocks tend to appreciate faster then others... find them to make the right bets!
